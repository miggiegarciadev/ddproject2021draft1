// E(Examples: play with the idea, write down things that

Function 1 - hello world

// // Write a function "greet" that returns "hello world!"
// Description:
// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most 
// creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to 
// show your friends?

// PREP 
//Parameters : no parameters listed so function is empty 
//Result: hello world!
//Example: return hello world! 
//Psuedo Code: I want to display the famous phase hello world! so i will have it returned as a string. 

function greet ( ){
return 'hello world!' 
}

// greet is an empty function because there are no parameters listed. 
// this is as creative as I could think because after first i was thinking of this problem too literally between the quotes and the exclamation point but some times simple is best
