//Instructions: 
//This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?
//the original problem had two equal signs and that is not how you assign a variable.
// one equal sign is what is used to assigned a variable 
//the log method helps me to do any debugging if anyyed 

//P name 
//R codewa.rs
//E double equal versus single equal sign 
//Psuedo Code 
//pay attn to how code is written and do research if needed

var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;
// console.log(name)
return name
